# Titanic Survival Analysis:
# Overview
This project analyzes the factors influencing passenger survival on the Titanic using the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information on the passengers, such as age, sex, ticket class, and other attributes. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to understand the key factors affecting survival rates.

# Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. metplotlib
4. seaborn
5. scikit-learn
You can install the required libraries using:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
# Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-analysis.git
cd titanic-survival-analysis
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis:
jupyter notebook titanic_analysis.ipynb or
python titanic_analysis.py
# Analysis
The analysis includes the following steps:
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and transforming data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of variables, relationships between features, and survival rates.
3.  Correlation Analysis: Examining the correlations between features to identify key factors influencing survival.
# Key Findings
1. Sex: Gender is a significant factor, with females having a higher survival rate than males.
2. Pclass: Passengers in higher ticket classes (1st and 2nd) had higher survival rates compared to those in the 3rd class.
3. Fare: Higher fare prices correlate with higher survival rates, indicating that wealthier passengers had better chances of survival.
